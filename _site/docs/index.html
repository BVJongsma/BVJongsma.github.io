        `Clue' is a murder mystery board game in which players aim to find out with what weapon someone was killed,
        where this person was killed and who is the murderer.
        Players ask each other for information in order to deduce this.

        Our goal is to model the game of Clue,
        analyse how it works and analyse what strategy is best to use if you want to win the game.
        We will first explain the game of Clue with the help of its official rules on page <a href="./game.html">Rules of Clue</a>.
        Next, we will delve deeper in what we want to analyse and implement on page <a href="./model.html">Model</a>.
        You can download the implementation at this page, as well.
