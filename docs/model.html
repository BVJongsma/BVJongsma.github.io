    <h1>Model and Implementation</h1>
    <p>
        We formalise <a href="./simplifications.html">the simplified game of Clue</a> in a model.
        We implement this model digitally using Python.
        On this page, we will describe our model and implementation.
        The implementation itself can be found on our <a href="https://github.com/BVJongsma/ClueModel" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

        <h2>Formal card and player representation</h2>
        <p>
            There are two different card categories: weapon and suspect.
            These are represented by the following sets:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Weapons = {axe, candle, dagger, handgun, lead, rope, wrench}
            </li>
            <li>
                Suspects = {Scarlet, Mustard, Green, Plum}
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Note that the cards in the weapon category are slightly different compared to the cards in the original Clue game.
            Instead of 'spanner', 'wrench' was used because the latter is a more well-known word for the same thing.
            'candlestick' and 'lead pining' were shortened.
            'revolver' was altered to the synonymous 'handgun'.
            This was done to ensure that all card names have a different first letter (which may be useful when we want to use concise notations for them).
        </p>
        <p>
            We will use the set \(\textrm{Cards} = \textrm{Weapons} \cup \textrm{Suspects}\) to refer to the set of all cards.
            There are three different players. We refer to them as 1, 2 and 3.
            That is, Players = {1, 2, 3}.
            The case file envelope is denoted by the singleton set Envelope = {\(\textrm{env}\)}
        </p>
        <p>
            Each player or envelope might have a certain card, and therefore we will make use of the notation \(card_j\).
            Here, \( card \in \textrm{Cards} \)
            and \(j \in \textrm{Players} \cup \textrm{Envelope}\). An example is \(\textrm{revolver}_2\), meaning that player 2 has the revolver.
            In the example \(\textrm{Scarlet}_{\textrm{env}}\), Scarlet is the suspect that is in the case file envelope.

    <!-- subsection 5.2: kripke model -->
    <div id="the-kripke-model">
        <h3>The Kripke Model</h3>
        <p>
            The Kripke model should represent the state combinations that include seven weapons,
            four suspects and three players.
            There is one weapon card and one suspect card in the envelope.
            This means that there are \(4 \times 4 = 16\) possibilities for the envelope.
            For the three players, there are nine cards left (weapons and suspects combined).
            This leads to there being \(\frac{9!}{3! \times (9-3)!} = 84\) possible card combinations for player 1.
            When three of the nine cards are given to player 1, that leaves six cards for player 2.
            In effect, there are \(\frac{6!}{3! \times (6-3)!} = 20\) possible combinations for player 2.
            For player 3 there is only one option: they are left with the \(6 - 3 = 3\) remaining cards.
            In total, this all results in \(16 \times 84 \times 20 \times 1 = 26880\) states.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each state contains one of the possible combinations of the 11 weapon and suspect cards.
            As an example, one such state is given by:
            axe\(_1\), candle\(_1\), dagger\(_1\),
            lead\(_2\), handgun\(_2\), rope\(_2\), Green\(_3\),
            Mustard\(_3\), Plum\(_3\), wrench\(_\textrm{env}\),
            Scarlet\(_\textrm{env}\).
            The envelope should contain one weapon and one suspect, but otherwise all cards are distributed randomly.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Kripke model \(M = \langle S, \pi, R_1, R_2, R_3 \rangle\) can be defined as follows:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    \(S\) is the total set of states \(s = \{s_1, s_{26880}\}\).
                    A state consists of a tuple of four pairwise disjoint sets:
                    >>>>>>>>>>>TODO change c_1 perhaps to c_env?????
                    \(s = \langle c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4 \rangle \).
                    The first of these sets denotes the cards in the envelope.
                    The second, third and fourth sets denote the cards of players 1, 2 and 3 respectively.
                    So, \(s = \langle \{card_{env}, card_{env}\}, \{card_1, card_1, card_1\}, \{card_2, card_2, card_2\}, \{card_3, card_3, card_3\} \rangle \).
                </li>
                <li>
                    \(\pi : P \rightarrow (S \rightarrow \{T, F\})\) assigns a truth value to all propositions P.
                </li>
                <li>
                    \( R_1, R_2\) and \(R_3\) denote the set of relations for each player 1, 2 and 3.
                    For each:
                    \(R_j \subseteq S \times S\) such that \(R_j = \{(s, t) \in S \times S | c_j \textrm{ in } s = c_j \textrm{ in } t\}\), where \(j \in Players\).
                    In other words, each player knows their own cards.
                </li>
            </ol>
            We implement the Kripke model digitally.

                then player \(j\) has that card.

        <h3>Updating the Kripke model</h3>
        <p>
            As the players take turns, they gain more and more information.
            During a turn, a player \(i \in Players\) first makes a suggestion \(sug_i\).
            This suggestion should consist of one weapon and one suspect: \(sug_i = \{A, B\}\) such that \( A \in Weapons \) and \(B \in Suspects \).
        </p>
        <p>
            The next player \(i + 1\) gives a response \(res_{i+1}\).
            There are two options:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Player \(i + 1\) does not have any of the cards suggested.
                    They share a public announcement:
                    \(\not \exists card_{i + 1}(card \in sug_i)\)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Player \(i + 1\) does have one or both of the cards suggested.
                    They share a public announcement:
                    \(\exists card_{i + 1}(card \in sug_i)\)
                    They pick one card_{i + 1} \in sug_i and share a private announcement for player \(i\) only:
                    \(card_{i + 1}\)
                    (Note that here, \(card_{i + 1}\) refers to a specific card, while in the public announcements, it refers to a variable.
                </li>

            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Using the public and private announcements and the rules in <a href="#formal-rules">Rules for gaining information</a>, all players update their knowledge.
            For our model, this means that relations in the Kripke model are (potentially) removed.
            After all, based on a player's new knowledge, this player knows that some states might not be possible anymore.
            All relations pointing to these states are removed for the player.
            A detailed example is given in <a href="./example.html">Example</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In our digital implementation, the Kripke model is indeed updated based on the players' newly gained information.
            Relations are removed iteratively after each player's turn.
            The rules described in <a href="#formal-rules">Rules for gaining information</a> are not explicitly stated in the implementation.
            Instead, these rules are elegantly, implicitly applied.
            This is because we only generate states for which the sets per agent and envelope (\(c_1, c_2, c_3 \textrm( and ) c_4 )\) are pairwise exclusive, for which these sets are of fixed lengths (two for the envelope, three for the players) and for which the envelope set always has one weapon and one suspect card.
            This limitation in the state generation makes it so that with little new information, a lot of relations can be directly removed.
            >>>>>>>>>>>>TODO EXPLAIN THIS better?!
        </p>
        <p>
            If for any player j, \(R_j \subseteq S \times S\) such that \(\forall R_j (R_j = \{(s, t) \in S \times S | c_1 \textrm{ in } t)\) (\(c_1\) is a constant here), they have won the game.
            In other words, if any player knows for sure what cards are in the envelope, they have won the game.
            In the Kripke model, this means that for this player j, there are only relations \(R_j\) left that are all pointed towards a state with one certain envelope set \(c_1\).
            Note that this does not have to mean that there is only one relation left for a player.
            For instance, a player might not have yet found out whether one specific card belongs to player P or Q, but does know what cards are in the envelope.
        </p>
        <p>
            In our implementation, after each player's turn, after the update of the Kripke model, the system goes through each player's relations in the Kripke model and checks, based on this, if there is a winner.
            The system then presents this winner and stops running.
            Notice that it might occur that there are multiple winners.
