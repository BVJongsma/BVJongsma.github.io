            <h3>Card and player representation</h3>

            There are two different card categories: weapon and suspect.
            These are represented by the following sets:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Weapons = {candlestick, dagger, rope, wrench}
                </li>
                <li>
                    Suspects = {Scarlet, Mustard, Green, Plum}
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                We will use the set \(\textrm{Cards} = \textrm{Weapons} \cup \textrm{Suspects}\) to refer to the set of all cards.
                There are three different players. We refer to them as 1, 2 and 3.
                That is, Players = {1, 2, 3}.
                The case file envelope is denoted by the singleton set Envelope = {\(\textrm{env}\)}
            </p>
            <p>
                Each player or envelope might have a certain card, and therefore we will make use of the notation \(i_j\).
                Here, \( i \in \textrm{Cards} \)
                and \(j \in \textrm{Players} \cup \textrm{Envelope}\). An example is \(\textrm{revolver}_2\), meaning that player 2 has the revolver.
                In the example \(\textrm{Scarlet}_{\textrm{env}}\), Scarlet is the suspect that is in the case file envelope.

                    with \(|Cards_j| = n\),
                    then if \(card \notin Cards_j\): \(\neg card_j\).

    <!-- subsection 5.2: kripke model -->
    <div id="the-kripke-model">
        <h2>The Kripke Model</h2>
        <strong>[TODO: add a formal definition of the Kripke model.]<br></strong>
        <p>
            The Kripke model should represent the state combinations that include four weapons,
            four suspects and three players.
            There is one weapon card and one suspect card in the envelope.
            This means that there are \(4 \times 4 = 16\) possibilities for the envelope.
            For the three players, there are six cards left (weapons and suspects combined).
            This leads to there being \(\frac{6!}{2! \times (6-2)!} = 15\) possible card combinations for player 1.
            When two of the six cards are given to player 1, that leaves four cards for player 2.
            In effect, there are \(\frac{4!}{2! \times (4-2)!} = 6\) possible combinations for player 2.
            For player 3 there is only one option: they are left with the \(4 - 2 = 2\) remaining cards.
            In total, this all results in \(16 \times 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 1440\) states.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each state contains one of the possible combinations of the 8 weapon and suspect cards.
            As an example, one such state is given by:
            candlestick\(_1\), dagger\(_1\),
            rope\(_2\), Scarlet\(_2\), Mustard\(_3\),
            Green\(_3\), wrench\(_\textrm{env}\),
            Plum\(_\textrm{env}\).
            Assume that this is the real-life situation, and use the following abbreviations:
            candlestick is c, dagger is d, rope is r, wrench is w, Scarlet is S, Mustard is M,
            Green is G and Plum is P. Now see figure 1, which shows a Kripke model of 3 states and their relations.
            The actual real-life state is shown in the top left.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="figures/example_kripke_reflexive.png" alt="kripke_example" style="width:100%">
            <figcaption>Fig.1 - Kripke model with 3 states and its relations.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            As far as relations go, the envelope does not have any relations,
            since we do not care about potential ways that the envelope can have the same card
            and about what the envelope `knows'. For the players, each player has relations
            from a state to another state if that players has the same cards in both states.
            From the previous example, player 1 has the candlestick and dagger in that state,
            so from that state can reach any state where they also have the candlestick and dagger.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now consider figure 1 and the relations that are shown there.
            Agent 1 can reach all states shown in the figure. In our model, we decided to only
            keep reflexive relations if the agent considers that state possible, since this
            reduces the amount of relations. A state is considered possible by an agent if
            the cards of that agent in the state correspond to the cards the agent actually has.
            As an example, agent 2 only has a reflexive relation in the top left state.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Kripke model is updated during every time step.
            Firstly, using public announcement when not showing a card.
            Secondly, using a private announcement when showing a card.
            Thirdly, the additional rules as described in the previous subsection are used.
        </p>
        <p>
            A player knows the cards in the envelope and will guess the cards in the envelope
            when all possible states that agent can reach have the same cards in the envelope.
