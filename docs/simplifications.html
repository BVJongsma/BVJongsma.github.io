<h1>Simplifications</h1>
<p>
    We want to simplify the official, full game of Clue to make it suitable for modelling and analysis.
    In order to do this, we limit the number of cards and modify some of the rules.
</p>
<p>
    To begin with, we dispose of the game board altogether.
    This means that players no longer have to roll dice and move their game tokens around the board.
    Rooms are no longer part of the game.
    This also means that players only need to find out what murder weapon and what suspect is in the case file envelope.
</p>
<p>
    We use three players that take turns one after each other.
    In each turn, a player can suggest a weapon-suspect combination to another player.
    Player 1 can only suggest to player 2, player 2 can only suggest to player 3, and player 3 can only suggest to player 1.
    If the other player has one, or both, of the cards that are suggested, they show one of their cards.
    They only show this card to the player who suggested. However, all players know that a card has been shown.
    If the other player has none of the suggested cards, they announce this publicly.
    This is the same as in the original game of Clue.
</p>
<p>
    We use seven weapon cards and four suspect cards for our initial model.
    This means that there is one weapon and one suspect in the case file envelope and that each player has three cards.
</p>
<p>
    Our simplified game ends in the same way as the official game.
    A player can make an accusation on what cards are in the envelope.
    Players can only make accusations if they know for sure what is in the envelope.
    This makes it impossible for players to make a false accusation and lose the game as a result.
    Players can derive what cards are in the envelope by making use of logic.
