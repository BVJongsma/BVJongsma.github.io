        `Clue' is a murder mystery board game in which players aim to find out with what weapon someone was killed,
        where this person was killed and who is the murderer.
        Players ask each other for information in order to deduce this.

    <p>
        Our goal is to model the game of Clue,
        analyse how it works and analyse what strategy is best to use if you want to win the game.
        Next, we will delve deeper in what we want to analyse and implement on page <a href="./model.html">Model</a>.
        You can download the implementation at this page, as well.

        For our project, we model a simplified version of the game of Clue.
        If you are unfamiliar with the rules, please visit the page <a href="./game.html">Rules of Clue</a>.
        We think that the game lends itself well for epistemic logical analysis.
        We will formally represent the cards, players and rules of the game.
        There are private announcements when one player shows another player a specific suggested card.
        Also, public announcements are involved, both when a player shows a suggested card to another player
        (even though what card is shown remains unknown for some players)
        and when a player states that they do not have any of the suggested cards.
        We model these public announcements using action models.
        We use Python to implement our model digitally.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other than just modelling Clue, we also explore different strategies that players can use, both in giving suggestions and in giving responses.
        Players can, for example, make suggestions at random, only make suggestions with cards that they have the least information on,
        and with the specific aim of eliminating cards that are possibly in the envelope.
        They can respond to suggestions at random, or only try to show cards that they have already shown.
        We implement these strategies in our digital program as well,
        to experimentally find out what strategies work well and why.
