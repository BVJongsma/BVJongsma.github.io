    <p>
        As explained in the Model section, an implementation of Clue in Python was created.
        This program makes use of a Kripke model and public and private announcements are used to update this
        model, so agents can eventually determine the cards in the envelope.
        We will now consider various strategies that can be used to determine the cards in the envelope and discuss
        their performance.

    <div id="strategies">
    <h2>The strategies</h2>
    <!-- TODO: determine which strategies to use, explain more -->
    <ul>
        <li>Random cards</li>
        <li>Pick two cards that the agent does not have themselves</li>
        <li>Pick one card that the agent has themselves and another that the agent does not have themselves</li>
        <li>Pick two cards for which the agent does not know to whom they belong</li>
        <li>Pick one card that the agent knows about and isn't of the next agent, and one unknown card</li>
        <li>Pick one card that the agent knows about and isn't of the next agent, and one card that might be of the next
         agent or in the envelope (or if there are none such cards: that might be of the next agent)</li>
    </ul>
