    <p>
        As explained in the Model section, an implementation of Clue in Python was created.
        This program makes use of a Kripke model and public and private announcements are used to update this
        model, so agents can eventually determine the cards in the envelope.
        We will now consider various strategies that can be used to determine the cards in the envelope and discuss
        their performance.
