    <h1>Experiment</h1>
    <p>
        As explained in the Model section, an implementation of Clue in Python was created.
        This program makes use of a Kripke model and public and private announcements are used to update this
        model, so agents can eventually determine the cards in the envelope.
        We will now consider various strategies that can be used to determine the cards in the envelope and discuss
        their performance.
    </p>
    <div id="strategies">
    <h2>The strategies</h2>
    Below we will outline the strategies that the players can use to select cards they will ask the next player about.
    These strategies vary in how much information is used. In some cases, no such cards exist and then the model will
    default to selecting one or both cards at random.
    <ul>
        <li>RANDOM: randomly pick a weapon and suspect card.</li>
        <li>NOT_OWN: pick a weapon card and a suspect card that the agent does not have themselves.</li>
        <li>ONE_OWN: pick a weapon and a suspect card, one of which the agent has themselves and another that the
            agent does not have themselves. </li>
        <li>UNKNOWN: pick a weapon and a suspect card for which the agent does not know to whom they belong.</li>
        <li>ONE_UNKNOWN: pick a weapon and a suspect card, where the agent knows who has one card, but not the other.</li>
        <li>REASONING: pick a weapon and a suspect card. Pick one card that the agent knows about and isn't of the next
            agent, so you do not see the same card multiple times. Pick the other card, so that it might be of the next
            agent or in the envelope. For this card you do not know where it is yet, and you know it might still belong
            to the next agent, so this should give you a lot of information. If there are no such cards: select one that
            might be of the next agent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The experimental setup</h2>
        <p>
            We tested the strategies mentioned above versus the random strategy. For each strategy, we ran the model
            until a winner was found ten times and determined the average amount of steps and the win rate of the first
            player.
